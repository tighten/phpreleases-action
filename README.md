# PHP Releases Action
Tired of manually keeping your GitHub actions workflow up to date with the PHP support schedule?  Use this action to generate an array of supported PHP versions for a GitHub Actions matrix. 

By default, this action uses the [PHP Releases API](https://phpreleases.com/) to retrieve the  PHP versions that are currently supported and formats them for a GitHub Actions matrix. Additional versions can be added to the matrix utilizing the `with` parameter. 

## Usage
```yaml
  # This job will need to run before the job that defines the matrix.
  output_releases:
    name: Generate PHP Releases Array
    # Requires a machine that can execute bash and make http requests.
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # Expose the variable for your dependent job.
    outputs:
      range: ${{ env.releases-array }}
    steps:
      - name: Fetch Current Releases
        uses: tighten/phpreleases-action@v2
        id: releases
 ```
 
### Create a matrix from the return value
```yaml
  current_php_releases:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # The matrix cannot be built before the job has finished.
    needs: output_releases
    strategy:
      matrix:
        # GitHub Actions expression to get the return value.
        php: ${{ fromJSON(needs.output_releases.outputs.range) }}
    name: PHP ${{ matrix.php }}
```
A full sample is available in this repo's [.github/workflows directory](https://github.com/tighten/phpreleases-action/blob/main/.github/workflows/main.yml).

### Add PHP versions that are not included by default
```yaml
  # This job will need to run before the job that defines the matrix.
  output_releases:
    name: Generate PHP Releases Array
    # Requires a machine that can execute bash and make http requests.
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # Expose the variable for your dependent job.
    outputs:
      range: ${{ env.releases-array }}
    steps:
      - name: Fetch Current Releases
        uses: tighten/phpreleases-action@v2
        id: releases
        with:
          # Comma delimited string of all versions that should be included in the matrix.
          releases: '7.4, 7.3'
```

        include:
        - os: Ubuntu

        - os: Windows
          os-version: windows-latest

          os-version: macos-latest

    name: ${{ matrix.os }} - PHP ${{ matrix.php }}

    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os-version }}
